pand-air-o
==========

Uses Leap Motion to create a virtual "air" pandeiro (Brazilian hand drum) playing experience.

This hack was inspired by the Brazilian hand drum called the pandeiro. It looks like a tambourine, and is played by hitting the drum head with different the palm and fingers at different locations. We tried to represent this playing experience by programming the Leap device to make the sounds a pandeiro makes - at least for 3 types of 'hits'. The hack samples real pandeiro audio clips that are triggered by the appropriate hand gestures. At the current stage, we can play a basic samba rhythm pattern.
